# Welcome to my blog!

This is where I plan to complete the Skills section of my DofE Award. You never know, I might continue it even after I've finished Bronze DofE!

#### Who's assessing me?

I'm being assessed by the amazing Lili Cooper. She used to tutor me when I was home-ed back in Year 6, but now she's off travelling around Europe with Abi.

#### What are my aims?

I hope to improve my communication skills, as well as in English writing. This will be especially helpful for my GCSEs as I move into Year 10.

#### What will I blog about?

Everything. What I've been doing over the summer holidays, how Year 10 is going for me. It'll just be me, chatting about my life. Don't expect a clear structure, because you'll certainly be disappointed!

### Alright then, let the games begin!

I need to keep blogging, I kinda realised (after constant reminders from Mum) that I haven't been blogging as much as I need to. I don't need to write much, but I need to actually write.

Today I spent most of the day in town with Holly and Joe. We spent most of the time just watching Joe spend money, but I had a coffee from Indigo so it was all worth it.

This evening I'm going to go and see a band called Breabach with Mum and Catherine, which I'm looking forward to. We've seen them twice before at the Cambridge Folk Festival, and they're a great band.

That's all I have to say! It wasn't that hard, to be honest :D
